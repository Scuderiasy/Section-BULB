Project Name: The Program for Assisting in Flash Communication Pattern Analysis in Fireflies based on Computer Vision

I study a doctoral degree in Biological Science program at Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Naresuan University, Thailand.

This program is a part of My doctoral thesis, Detection of Flash Communication Pattern in Fireflies by high-throughput and precision method.
This program was made to assist and help to study the flashing behavior the researcher and who is interesting in firefly flashing behavior.

The sub-program, Section BULB were used to analyze the flashing behavior and provide the output: flash area, time-related of occurrence flash, and coordinated position. 
This raw data can be interpreted to the flash pattern, pulse duration, and flash interval. However, the pulse duration and flash interval data require the sub-program Section GEMINI.

This program was written based on computer vision to understand the firefly flash in footage of video. 
The suitable video for analyzing with this program should recording under the low-light condition and without infrared light source (recommend).

The EMGU CV was used as digital image processing library, the application of this program must follow to EMGU Open Source License.
In addition, this program is the C# platform which builds through Visual Studio Community 2015, the application of this program must follow to the License also.

The detail of this program was mentioned in Publication and Thesis. 
I am a beginner programmer if you have the comment, suggestion, question. please feel free to contact me.
